This is an implementation of a 'pretty triangle' printing program.
It uses Lambda functions/interface to enable printing of 4 different
types of 'right triangles', some slanted to left, some to right, some
increasing downward, some increasing upward (and in-between).

I was pretty happy with the outputTriangle() function except in one
regard.  I wished I could 'pass in' an appropriate increment or decrement
function that I could pass as a parameter.  I'm not sure how to do that,
yet.
